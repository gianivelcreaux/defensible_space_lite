Defensible Space Calculator for Wildfires
by Sean L Mooney 


ABOUT THIS PROJECT

This is the light version of the Defensible Space Calculator web application I developed for the Mill Valley Fire Department. It is a basic JavaScript calculator built on the fire-hazard-assessment matrix used by the Fire Department to determine the amount of defensible space that must be created based upon combustible fuels (vegetation) surrounding a property.

The files are written in PHP, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

I have relied on the HTML5 Lightbox to showcase the images of each vegetation type. http://html5box.com/html5lightbox/index.php


CUSTOMIZATION

Fuel Types:

If you have different fuel types than used in this file you can edit the HTML directly in the matrix_calculator.php file (located in forms folder) to reflect the fuel types you encounter. Corresponding images are located in the "images" folder. This site uses a shadow box effect to open images as an overlay on the site.
